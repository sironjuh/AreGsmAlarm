This repository is just for thes torage purposes.

This is an old Java app for managing alarms from Niagara (https://www.tridium.com/) systems. 
Serial communication was originally dependant on http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

Now updated to https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial and using Maven for builds, just so that it can be run for the nostalgy. :)
